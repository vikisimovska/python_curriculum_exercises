# Flask Routing

Build a simple calculator! You should have routes that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division with two numbers so if a request is made to `/add/2/2` the server should respond with `4`.

### Bonus

Refactor your code so that all of these operations can be done in a single route called `/math`
